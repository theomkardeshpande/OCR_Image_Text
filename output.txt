HERMES DIRECTOR:
A TYPEFACE FOR SCHMUCKS

I enjoy putting my curvytop Hermes 3000
through its paces. Everything I heard
about this typewriter is true. But the
more I use my H3K, the more I dislike
its Director typeface.

Hermes' Director typestyles are just bolder
enough than regular pica that if you beng
out more than a paragraph or two the re-
sult comes dangerously akin to shouting.

And that's the reason for these typefaces,
I've decided. Born of Old Europe's strati-
fied society, Director is designed to be
used only by bosses, CEOs, and various and
sundry overseers. Open a letter produced in
Director and ... ZUT ALORS! ... you know
it's much more important than something from
some pica-typing plebe.

The New World wasn't immune to this snooti-
nessa, either. Smith-Corona had several
typefaces that filled this ecological niche,
as well. Empire No. 65 and Presidential Pica
No. 78 look similar te Director Pica/Special,
and the description -—- at least what's visible
in its NOMDA guide -~ shows these uppity type-
styles ere geared toward "executives."

I wonder if any successful author ever turned
in a book-length manuscript in Director Pica
or Director Special. Reading even e few pages
in this typeface can be exhausting.

Aa I wrong to think that these "executive" faces
help underscore asshole behavior? Do I come

off like a poseur for even using Director

and daring to type above may station?
